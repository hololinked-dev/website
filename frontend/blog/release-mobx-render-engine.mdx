mobx-render-engine is a JSON driven react component renderer based on <Link to="https://mobx.js.org/README.html">`MobX`</Link>. 
I originally created this for writing an object oriented specification of react components in python & converting this 
python code to JSON to render them in React, or have a drag and drop dashboard. MobX was chosen as the state manager for reactively updating 
the state of the components (rather than 'selectively', as done with some other libraries). This is suitable for writing dashboards for data-acquisition 
applications because such dashboards are data-intensive and require decent performance from the browser. <br/>
As with my other libraries, its not fully functional, however as an example of converting python to React, under 
<Link to="https://github.com/VigneshVSV/hololinked/tree/main/hololinked/webdashboard">`hololinked.webdashboard`</Link> namespace, 
one can find certain components defined like <Link to="https://github.com/react-grid-layout/react-grid-layout">react-grid-layout</Link>, 
MUI components from <Link to="https://mui.com/">React MUI</Link> like Button, TextField etc.    
Consider the `<GraphDisplay />` component which I posted the code 
<Link to="https://hololinked.dev/docs/Spectrometer%20GUI/spectrometer-gui-in-reactjs-layout-spectrum-graph">here</Link>.
To write this in python, one can do the following:

To render this in react, mobx-render-engine defines the following logic (not necessarily in order):

<h4>1. define components and read state from MobX</h4> 
Each component has its own state implemented in MobX from which the props are read while rendering. For example, a 
button component is implemented as follows:

```tsx showLineNumbers title='mui button'
import Button from '@mui/material/Button';
import { observer } from 'mobx-react-lite';

const ContextfulMUIButton = observer((state) => {

    const { classes, color, component, disabled, disableElevation, ... endIcon, fullWidth, 
			href, size, startIcon, variant, centerRipple, ... , onClick } = state.computedProps 

    return (
        <Button 	
            classes={classes}
            color={color}
            ...
            disabled={disabled}
            disableElevation={disableElevation}
            disableRipple={disableRipple}
            ...
            fullWidth={fullWidth}
            variant={variant}
            ...
            onClick={onClick}
        >
            {... children logic ... }
        </Button>
    )
})
```
To implement these components is the duty of the developer who provides the components to the python user. The components
can be as granular (like a p-tag) or as composite as necessary and should be purpose-driven - do one or a few tasks 
correctly/accurately instead of trying to accomplish a blatant translation of python (or JSON) to React/HTML. 
For example, since I wish to provide the python user with a button, one can see there is no useState, useEffect etc. 
(which are react constructs) since the purpose of this button will be to fire an onClick callback (which will be a HTTP 
request and will be discussed later). In this way, it is possible to specify this button as a python object without 
having to ask the python developer to learn what is useState and useEffect (if it were so, it is better to simply learn React). 
Some examples are hosted in <Link to="https://github.com/VigneshVSV/MUI-mobx-react-render-engine">MUI-mobx-render-engine</Link> 
and <Link to="https://github.com/VigneshVSV/hololinked-dashboard-components.git">hololinked-dashboard-components</Link>.

<h4>2. store all component states in a map</h4> 
The state of all components is stored in a large map with the html-id being the key and a MobX state container being the value. The MobX state container is
a class that has `makeObservable` defined, and inferring from the example (ContextfulMUIButton) above - the `computedProps` computed property. This state is stored within the `RenderEngine` class which performs the 
rendering. `RenderEngine.componentStateMap` has the following type:
```tsx showLineNumbers
 type ComponentStateMap = {
    [key : string] : ComponentState
}
```
The rendering can be triggered as follows: 
```tsx showLineNumbers title='using the renderer'
import RenderEngine from 'mobx-render-engine';

const App = () => {

    const renderer = useState<RenderEngine>(new RenderEngine())
    const [rendererReady, setRendererReady] = useState<boolean>(false)
    
    useEffect(() => {
        /* logic to fetch a JSON specifiction from somewhere and populate the componentStateMap */
        fetchComponents = async() => {
            let response = await axios.get("my.gui.server:8085/pages/sample") 
            /* logic to prepare renderer based on response yet to be written */
            setRendererReady(response.status===200)
            /* say fetch is successful*/
        }
        fetchComponents()
    }, [])

    return (
        <>
            {rendererReady? renderer.Component('__App__') : <SomeLoadingComponent />}
        </> 
    )
}

```


<h4>3. A RenderEngine iterates the component state map and compare with available components</h4>
The renderer (instance of RenderEngine) knows to render a component only when the component was registered after instantiation of `RenderEngine` and 
before triggering the rendering with the `Children` method. The html-id `__App__` (`ReactApp` class in python-side) is reserved for triggering the rendering which will render all the components.
The `registerComponent()` method should be called with a unique component name and the component itself. For example, the ContextfulMUIButton 
created above can be registered like the following:    

```tsx showLineNumbers {11} title="registering components to renderer"
import { RenderEngine } from "mobx-render-engine";

import { ContextfulMUIButton } from "./components/Button";
import { ContextfulMUITextField } from "./components/TextField";
import { ContextfulMUIBox } from "./components/Box";
import { ContextfulMUIDivider } from "./components/Divider";
import { ContextfulMUIStack } from "./components/Stack";

export function prepareRenderers(renderers : RenderEngine[]) {
    for (let renderer of renderers){
        renderer.registerComponent("ContextfulMUIButton", ContextfulMUIButton)
        renderer.registerComponent("ContextfulMUIStack", ContextfulMUIStack)
        ...
        renderer.registerComponent("ContextfulMUItextField", ContextfulMUITextField)
    }
}
```

<h4>4. The supplied JSON should contain the component name, html-id & props (among others)</h4>

A JSON should be provided from an external source to the RenderEngine, for example through a file or a HTTP request to 
a server fetching JSON created from a different language. Since we register the component based on name, 
the JSON provided must contain must have the following fields:

```JSON showLineNumbers title="ContextfulMUIButton example JSON" 
{
    "some-unique-html-id" : {
        "componentName": "ContextfulMUIButton",
        "id": "some-unique-html-id",
        "props": {
                "sx": null,
                "centerRipple": false,
                "disabled": false,
                "disableRipple": false,
                "disableTouchRipple": false,
                "focusRipple": false,
                "focusVisibleClassName": null,
                ...
                "color": "primary",
                "disableElevation": false,
                "endIcon": null,
                "fullWidth": true,
                "size": "medium",
                "startIcon": null,
                "variant": "contained",
                "onClick": {
                    ... will be discussed in actions ...
                }
        },
        "children": [
            "Connect"
        ]
}}
```

In `hololinked.webdashboard`, this is generated in python using descriptor protocol (based on <Link to="https://param.holoviz.org/">`param`</Link>) to provide a validated server-side 
JSON. The RenderEngine accepts this JSON and composes the MobX observable class `ComponentState`, from where props (`computedProps`), children (called `computedChildren`)
are retrived. <br/>
As a side note, in reality the JSON is accepted by a class named `StateManager` which creates the `ComponentState` map and passes it on to the render engine which is its own attribute
(`StateManager.renderer`). Further, all the children are specified using html-ids. In case of the button, we can specify the text 
as a child of the button which will be rendered directly as text. One could also use a text prop instead of children prop to render button text in order to not confuse the python developer 
what 'children' means in React.    
The JSON is also has a flat heirarchy - a certain component's JSON are never nested inside other component's JSON. For example, if one wants to render an icon within the button (like a send icon),
the JSON would look as follows:
```JSON showLineNumbers title="JSON for rendering react children"
{
    "some-unique-parent-html-id" : {
        props : {...}
        "id" : "some-unique-parent-html-id",
        "componentName" : "ContextfulMUIButton",
        "children" : ["Connect", "connect-symbol-mui-icon-unique-id"]
    }
    "connect-symbol-mui-icon-unique-id" : {
        props : {...}
        "id" : "connect-symbol-mui-icon-unique-id",
        "componentName" : "ContextfulMUIIcon",
        "children" : []
    }
}
``` 
The `ContextfulMUIButton` button logic would be now:

```tsx showLineNumbers {1,14} title="rendering children with render engine"
const ContextfulMUIButton = observer((state, renderer) => {

    const { classes, color, component, disabled, disableElevation, ... endIcon, fullWidth, 
			href, size, startIcon, variant, centerRipple, ... , onClick } = state.computedProps 

    return (
        <Button 	
            classes={classes}
            color={color}
            ...
            ...
            onClick={onClick}
        >
            {renderer.Children(state.computedChildren)}}
        </Button>
    )
})
```
<h4>5. props & mobx-state can be changed with predefined actions & state machine</h4>
Importantly, the dashboard or webpage comes alive only when the props are changed. Similar to how `MobX` updates observables
with actions, mobx-render-engine allows definitions of global actions which can change the state of any component. 
When the state of a specific component is changed, the computedProps method is triggered by MobX automatically 
for the said component.  
Further, a state-machine is implemented which applies predefined props based on a state-machine state (different from MobX 
use of word 'state' in previous sentence). As an example, consider the `onClick` callback for the MobXButton. Currently, 
I have a implemented a pre-defined axios request object which can be specified also with a JSON.

The onClick callback is resolved from a JSON to a function during ComponentState creation, 
before passing on to the renderer (`StateManager.renderer`). The general behaviour of such props like onClick below is 
an action that changes the MobX state of a certain component (not necessarily its own). 
```tsx showLineNumbers {1,14} title="resolved onClick callback"
const ContextfulMUIButton = observer((state, renderer) => {

    const { classes, color, ... , onClick } = state.computedProps 

    return (
        <Button 	
            ...
            ...
            onClick={onClick}
        >
            {renderer.Children(state.computedChildren)}}
        </Button>
    )
})
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

There are many other actions currently defined, such as EventSource, repeated requests at intervals, set state machine state 
(frontend-only component state machine), store component value (like textfield value, checkbox/slider value) etc. 
These actions are specified as JSON in the python side and are resolved into functions. Again, to implement the react side definition 
of these actions is the duty of the developer who provides the python components to the python user. <br />
Moreover, if these actions contain JSON data or return JSON data (say a HTTP response) compliant to the JSON schema of component state, 
they will be automatically applied by mobx-render-engine (no need for separate react state management). 
The JSON should be return under a field specified under UIComponents:

```JSON showLineNumbers title="response data schema for automatically updating (any) component state"
{
    data : {
        returnValue : {
            UIComponents : {
                "some-existing-component-html-id" : {
                    "props" : { ... new props here ... },
                    "children" : {... new children here ...}
                },
                "some-other-existing-component-html-id" : {
                    "props" : { ... new props here ... },
                    "children" : {... new children here ...}
                },
                "a-new-component-html-id" : {
                    "props" : {... new component props ... }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}    
```
For example, if the onClick callback of `ContextfulMUIButton` returns a JSON containing new props for existing components or 
new state for a new component, they will be applied automatically. The existing components will change their props and new 
components will be rendered. 

<h4>6. the results of actions & the stored value of components can also be assigned to props</h4>
Very similar to the previous stated, one can also use the result of actions to update props directly. 

```python showLineNumbers title="set props from actions"
from hololinked.webdashboard.components import Slider, TextField

class MyApp(ReactApp):

    def initComponents(self):
        self.slider = Slider(
            ... 
        )

        self.textField = TextField(
            id='...',
            sx=dict(
                fontSize=self.slider.value
            )
        )
```
Components that have potential to retain a value (which many of them do, especially input components) always write their 
new value to a `ComponentOutputMap` (`StateManager.componentOutputMap`) when changed. This value can be accessed by any component 
and any action using the dot operator in python (specifically .value). This allows for actions like HTTP requests to access 
component's value for request body, and in general for updating props directly with a new value without needing a server to 
host the GUI. In my examples, there is a server that provides the JSON from python, however this is only for convenience 
and is not in anyway related to the working of the mobx-render-engine. The mobx-render-engine can also render from JSON files. <br />For 
actions to access a component's value, similar logic can be used as follows:

```python showLineNumbers
from hololinked.webdashboard import makeRequest

class MyApp(ReactApp):

    def initComponents(self):
        # previous code 
        self.button = Button(
            onClick = makeRequest(
                url = f"{self.serverAddress}/{self.deviceInstanceName}/instructions",
                method = "post", 
                data = {
                    "state" : "RUNNING",
                    "command" : self.textField.value,
                    "return_data_size" : self.slider.value # say
                }
            )
            fullWidth = True, 
            variant = 'contained',
            id = "send-instruction-button",
            children = "Send",
        )
     
```
The data accompanying actions will be deep-updated always before executing the action, in this case a HTTP request. 
Similar, actions themselves stored their last returned value (like HTTP response or event data) which can be accessed with 
the dot operator in python and will update the components accessing it when the return value is updated.  

<h4>7. actions are also structured to facilitate JSON resolution</h4>
Finally, to help resolve the JSON specification of the 'predefined global actions' which change the states of any component, 
they are structured with following options. Each action must define a
* `call()` which runs the action 
* `cancel()` which cancels the action if possible 
* `cleanup()` which frees the memory and called on component unmount

The repository is hosted at github <Link to="https://github.com/VigneshVSV/mobx-render-engine">here</Link>. One can try 
it with <Link to="https://github.com/VigneshVSV/hololinked-portal">hololinked-portal</Link> under 'quick-dashboard-view'.
The JSON can be generated with examples from <Link to="https://github.com/VigneshVSV/mobx-render-engine-python-examples">python examples repository</Link>.
Unfortunately docusaurus (which created this website) is optimized for server side rendering and I do not know how to mount MobX 
to make the examples come alive with SSR. mobx-render-engine is meant to be used for apps with client side rendering.
