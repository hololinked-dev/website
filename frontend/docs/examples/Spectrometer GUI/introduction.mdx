# Spectrometer GUI

This article is a logical continuation of the spectrometer device dealt in [hololinked python docs](https://hololinked.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/server/spectrometer/index.html).
After the device server works, one will require a GUI to interact with it. In this example, a dashboard based on ReactJS & [React Material UI](https://mui.com/) will be built. 
There is a [template repository here](https://github.com/VigneshVSV/hololinked-gui-examples-template) 
where one can install all dependencies used by this example, please follow the corresponding README. 

###### Knowledge Prerequisites to follow without a problem
- ReactJS with hooks  
- React Material UI
